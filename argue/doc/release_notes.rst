v0.1 series

v0.1.3
======

The library remains still very much in alpha territory. This release includes
a couple of exciting new features though. In particular, all programs which
use ``argue`` for argument parsing automatically support:

1. bash completion (no custom completion script necessary!)
2. generated command line documentation using a JSON representation of the
   command tree
